- 2025-09-30 – Designed the high-level Agent work loop and added a Mermaid diagram under “Iteration rhythm”. Outcome: keep the loop intentionally high-level, cap cycles to x (default 5).
- 2026-02-15 – Ran first end-to-end pilot loop on FlowLite: added `HistoryStore`, wired engine emissions, enforced PascalCase enums, and validated with tests. Outcome: FlowLite test suite green; pilot ready for iteration.
